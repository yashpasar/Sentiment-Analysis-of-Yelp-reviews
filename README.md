# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Yelp-reviews
Algorithms used: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors and Artificial Neural Network

## Introduction:
Sentiment analysis is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that consists in extracting emotions related to some raw texts. This is usually used on social media posts and customer reviews in order to automatically understand if some users are positive or negative and why. The goal of this study is to show how sentiment analysis can be performed using python. 

## Here are some of the main libraries we will use:
NLTK: the most famous python module for NLP techniques
Gensim: a topic-modelling and vector space modelling toolkit

Gensim module
Scikit-learn: the most used python machine learning library

We will use here some hotel reviews data. Each observation consists in one customer review for one hotel. Each customer review is composed of a textual feedback of the customerâ€™s experience at the hotel and an overall rating. The data can be found in my github folder.

## Goal
For each textual review, we want to predict if it corresponds to a good review (the customer is happy) or to a bad one (the customer is not satisfied).
